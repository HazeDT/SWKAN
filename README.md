# SWKAN
This is the code library for the implementation of GWAN. [SWKAN: An Ante-Hoc and Post-Hoc Explainable Spectral Enhanced Wavelet Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks for Reliable Fault Diagnosis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298276).

# Note
In SWKAN, a spectral enhancement module (SEM) is designed to suppress noise and highlight informative spectral components of measured signals, and then the wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold module (WKAM) with learnable scale parameter and translation parameter is proposed to achieve ante-hoc explainable feature extraction.
